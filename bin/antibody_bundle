# After changing plugins branch, you must execute 'antibody purge' to remove caches, and then
# bundle again. Also see ~/.dotfiles/bin/antibody_purge.

# The command 'antibody update' pulls new commits from remote, so if you've specified a branch
# in plugins.txt, you won't want to run 'antibody update' command.

# Zsh 5.3.1 is required.

# Below code snippets may make zsh startup fast, but it's not the truth for my laptop.
# Based on my research, the most high cost is the call `compinit`, it makes the startup
# time 1x slower(from 0.8~ to 1.8~). Currently, it's better for me to enable it in shell
# manually. So I just comment below codes.
#
# Here's the quoted comment from https://gist.github.com/ctechols/ca1035271ad134841284:
#
# On slow systems, checking the cached .zcompdump file to see if it must be
# regenerated adds a noticable delay to zsh startup.  This little hack restricts
# it to once a day.  It should be pasted into your own completion file.
#
# The globbing is a little complicated here:
# - '#q' is an explicit glob qualifier that makes globbing work within zsh's [[ ]] construct.
# - 'N' makes the glob pattern evaluate to nothing when it doesn't match (rather than throw a globbing error)
# - '.' matches "regular files"
# - 'mh+24' matches files (or directories or whatever) that are older than 24 hours.
autoload -Uz compinit
# if [[ -n ${ZDOTDIR}/.zcompdump(#qN.mh+24) ]]; then
#   compinit
# else
#   compinit -C
# fi

# Bash-like help support. To find help files, we may also need to set HELPDIR environment variable with
# something like /path/to/zsh_help_directory.
